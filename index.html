        <h2>TypeScript Angular, Java Spring Boot, MySQL Web App</h2>
        <p>Created this small app by myself over a few weekends. The app tracks the bathroom trips taken by the family dog Matilda. It has an Angular frontend, spring boot backend, with MySQL as the database. It only takes 2 taps on the phone to add the current time to be logged.</p>
