        <h2>Where When Why What Who</h2>
        <h6>Developer: Coleman Dietsch</h6>
        <p>
            Here in Saint Paul, we have limited options for dedicated bicycle courier services. Not only are there hardly any bicycle couriers,
            but none of the businesses that I found seemed to offer a form to request new jobs on their websites (besides a contact us for a quote form).
        </p>
        <p>
            This site will be a place where users can create postings for delivery jobs that they need done. The
            users will create a new job post that includes the job contact info (name, email, phone), pickup address, delivery
            address, cargo description (like product, quantity, weight, volume, etc). The users will be required to take photos to verify item
            descriptions. I think for now I will have the user put in the cash payment they are offering for the job but if I
            have time, I would like to come up with an algorithm that takes the distance between the pickup and delivery addresses and
            multiplies it by an amount to calculate payments instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is for local people in Saint Paul who have time sensitive deliveries. Bicycle couriers have advantages for getting around
            busy parts of the city, especially during peak rush hour traffic.
        </p>
