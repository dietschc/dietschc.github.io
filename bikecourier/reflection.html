        <h2>Final Reflections</h2>
        <h3>By Coleman Dietsch</h3>
        <p>
            One of the first major problems I encountered was getting PHP warnings about empty text fields when you first
            load a page that has a form that uses POST data. The fix I found was to use a combination of the PHP isset()
            function in conjunction with the PHP ternary operator. This will set the text field to the string value from
            the POST data for that input text field if it exists, otherwise set the text field to an empty string if
            the POST data is null. Without this fix, PHP inserts the warnings directly into the text fields, which is
            annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time we were halfway done with the course I realized that I had a few ideas for the site that were
            overly ambitious for the time frame we had to work on this project. The first major issue I realized was
            implementing users on the site. Adding user signups, authentication, sessions, and permissions is not a
            trivial task. The second major issue with my design has to do with google maps, addresses, and formatting.
            I did not have time to get these features added to the site, but I would like to add them in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was happy with how the final site layout turned out. It is pretty close to the
            <strong><a href="graphic/layout.png">original design</a></strong>
            that I created. Especially the
            <strong><a href="showJSONData.php">showJSONData.php page.</a></strong>
            It is pretty close, minus the maps that I would really have liked to have working. I was even happy with the
            <strong><a href="createJob.php">create new jobs page.</a></strong>
            It can and does create new jobs which show up on the rest of the site, as intended. I realize now also that
            having a form this complicated was maybe not a good idea for this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned a great deal from this project and after completing this term project I have a newfound respect
            for both client-side and server-side software developers. The amount of effort and knowledge that goes into
            planning, designing, implementing, updating, and adding new features to a web application is astounding.
            Even simple web apps have a lot more going on under the hood than most people realize.
